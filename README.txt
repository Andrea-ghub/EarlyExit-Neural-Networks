In the drive folder are present 4 folders and 5 files. The "Papers", ".ipynb_checkpoints", "Other attempts" folders are not of interest for the present discussion. The 5 files present are just the datasets and some maps that are used by our notebook.  

The folder where you can find our models is the "Pretrained" folder. Inside of this folder there are other 2 folders and 5 files.  

 

 

    -The two folders are "Resize" and "Models" where we saved the weights of our models.  

    -Then there is a "utils.py" file where we keep classes that are used in the notebooks.  

    -The "deeplake_labels_map.pkl" file contains the map to convert our labels to the deeplake one. 

    -The "imagenet_labels2class_map.pkl" file contains the map to convert our labels to the corresponding imagenet class name. 

    -The "train" notebooks are the ones that we used to train our models. 

    -The "test" notebook contains a code that test all of our models on the validation dataset and then compute the are for the models that we have chosen to submit to this challenge.
